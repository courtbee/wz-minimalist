## WZ Minimalist Maps

A set of minimalist [SWTOR](http://www.swtor.com) warzone maps.

Inspiration: football and basketball court charts.

All source files are included and have been exported to formats friendly to those unable to access a program such as Adobe Illustrator. Primary focus was on making minimalist maps that are printer-friendly and also easy to mark up in a graphics editor or by hand.

* EPS
* AI (CS6)
* AI Legacy (CS3-6)
* PDF
* PSD 
* PNG
* JPG
* GIF (low quality format)

## Novare Coast

Novare Coast either looks like a female torso, a monkey face, or an expression of someone not amused at what happened to their mouth after eating a tube of hemorrhoid cream. I'll probably be tweaking this one more in the future.

## More to come?

I'd love to develop some type of web app that allows people to drag member icons, draw lines and export the end result into a graphic. My skillset falls more to the design end with CSS/HTML however, and not so much on the programm-y type stuff. Feel free to explore this concept. :)

## Legacy Formats

If a legacy version is not working, please let me know. However, I can only test with CS5 so your assistance in making sure it works with earlier versions is necessary to fix the issue.

## Why GitHub?

Look, I get it. Trying to do version control on images is silly. I've never tried it, but what the heck, right? It's there and it's an easy way to distribute this project. Maybe there is a better place, but I really wanted to make sure people could easily obtain source files.
